     <p>Hola Guys!</p>
     <p>I will start my today's blog with a beautiful quote: <br><em>"We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope." - Martin Luther King, Jr."</em><br>I plunged my 10 years into a dream of becoming an IAS officer. My incompetency lead me into a trap of procrastination and all my dreams slowly and steadily faded away. All the illusion of becoming an extraordinary girl constrain me in the tunnel. I don't know how a diminutive ray of hope reflected towards me and an instant realization of propelling my potential in a new direction. This time no daydreaming, only practice,practice and a lot more pactice. <br>Thank you for being with me!</p>
